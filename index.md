# IT Explorations

### Summary of learning

This course was an eye opening course in that it showed how in depth and the complexity of the IT field.  Some of the more important things I learned were about the various computer languages, types of software, differences in hardware, the idea of creating a virtual machine, and the ability to code web pages.  Although we didn't focus on learning the actual computer languages, it helped to show me that there are many options and possibilities when it comes to coding which leads to many more oppportunities if you're willing to put in the effort to learn the languages.  I never thought of software as something complex, but just programs that can be used in computers. I didn't put the thought into how the developement life cycle works and how its an evolving process that continues to support the program even after it's been released to the public.  When it comes to hardware, I never understood the many components of how a computer is put together and how they all work.  I'd like to focus on this aspect and be able to build a computer from the ground up and this course has given me a foundation on which to build off of.  The biggest eye opener for me was the idea of using a different O/S on top of my current O/S.  Being able to boot a different O/S from a flash drive was not on my list of what I had expected to learn, and that really showed me how little I understood on what goes on in the IT field.  Lastly, I had never had experience in being able to code.  Using Github is an important first step and really opens the door for me.  I think with the knowleged i've gained, I will be able to build off my current career which focuses on data.  Having a better understanding on what goes on behind that data will only serve in helping me to comprehend that data.
